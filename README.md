# ChatbotFront

[//]: # (Write simple Readme about my chatbot. I wrote it in React using vite and typescript. I used socket.io for communication with server. I used react-hook-form for form validation. I used react-icons for icons. I used react-use for hooks. Whoever wants to use my project can do it. It can be modyfied and used for any purpose. You can/should write your own css styling. This chatbot automatically is connected to dedicated server which you can find in my repositories. I recommend to use it with my server. Contact me if you are interested in my server. I will send you pricing and other details.)
